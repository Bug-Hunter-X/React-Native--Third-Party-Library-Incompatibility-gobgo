The solution is dependent on the nature of the incompatibility.  Here are some common approaches:

1. **Find a React Native compatible alternative:**  Search for a library that explicitly supports React Native or that has fewer dependencies that conflict with the React Native environment.  The npm package page usually indicates React Native compatibility.
2. **Modify the library to work with React Native:** If the incompatibility is due to specific module usage or environmental checks, you might be able to modify the library code itself (if you have access). This is usually more complex.
3. **Wrap the problematic library's components or functions with React Native compatible components or shims:** This may involve creating your own React Native components that interact with the library in a way that overcomes the incompatibility.
4. **Implement a conditional import or use the library only on supported platforms:** If you can identify the platform on which the problem arises (e.g., Android) use platform-specific code to either use a different implementation or skip using the library altogether on unsupported platforms. 

Example (Conditional Import):
```javascript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

let MyComponent;

if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  MyComponent = require('my-ios-compatible-library').MyComponent;
} else {
  MyComponent = require('my-react-native-compatible-library').MyComponent; 
}

// Use MyComponent
```
