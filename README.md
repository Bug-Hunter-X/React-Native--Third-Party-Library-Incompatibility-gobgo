This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development where incompatibility with third-party libraries causes unexpected behavior or crashes, especially in production Android builds.  The example uses a hypothetical library to illustrate the problem. The solution involves finding a compatible alternative or making adjustments to the library usage to resolve any environment-specific conflicts.
