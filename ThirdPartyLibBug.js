This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not compatible with React Native's environment. For example, you might be using a library that depends on Node.js modules that aren't available in the React Native environment. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, particularly on Android.  The issue may not show up immediately during development but will appear in production builds.
